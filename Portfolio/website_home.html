                    <dd>The about tab gives you a glimsp into the person I am, not only professionally but also personally.
                        I provide a synopsis of my education inside and outside of coding, as well as paint picture of who I am
                        as a person.</dd>

                            showcase and I believe gives an honest representation of my skills as a developer.</dd>
                        <dd>All Projects is a list of everything I have previously developed as well as a blog that logs the
                        development of each project.</dd>
