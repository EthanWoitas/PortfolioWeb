            <h2>Welcome to Ethan's place</h2>
            <p>What is my place? My place is a website I have built as a project and a space to develop my front end skills, showcase my work in a portfolio, 
            as well as give insight towards who I am as a person. Conceptually, each tab above will be styled differently in a way that
            reflects their functions. While this page may appear primitive, the stylings will greatly differ from page to page.
            Below will explain the navigation bar and describe the logic behind the styling.

                    <dt style="text-decoration: underline 1px;">About</dt>
                        <dd>The about tab gives you a glimpse into the person I am, not only professionally but also personally.
                        I provide a synopsis of my education inside and outside of coding, as well as paint picture of who I am
                        as a person.
                        </dd>
                        <dd>As such, I've decided to style it with personality. There are elements of humour and passion, and simply doesn't
                        take it self too seriously while still being functional.
